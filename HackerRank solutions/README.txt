Efficient, readable solutions to HackerRank problems. Most solutions are written in Java, with some witten in Python. All solutions solve for 100% of test cases.

Problems are usually evaluated by feeding input into STDIN and checking solutions printed to STDOUT. The code for reading input is often 
provided; sometimes the code for printing output is provided as well. I've included this code where possible to give a complete picture
of what a given solution is doing.

Code is often provided with import statements. These tend to be wide in scope; I've removed unused import statements where I've
spotted them.

Comments are minimal as the problem statements generally provide a sufficient overview of what the code is doing. Where the problem can easily be explained in a comment I have done this; where it cannot I have linked to the problem statement.
