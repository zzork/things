Solutions to HackerRank problems. Most solutions are written in Java, with some in Python. All solutions solve for 100% of test cases.

Problems are usually evaluated by feeding input into STDIN and checking solutions printed to STDOUT. The code for reading input is often 
provided; sometimes the code for printing output is provided as well. I've included this code where possible to give a complete picture
of what a given solution is doing.

Code is often provided with import statements. These tend to be wide in scope; I've removed unused import statements where I've
spotted them.
