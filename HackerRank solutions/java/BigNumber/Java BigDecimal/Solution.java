/* Given an array, s, of n real number strings, sort them in descending order â€” but wait, there's more! Each number must be printed in the 
 * exact same format as it was read from stdin, meaning that .1 is printed as .1, and 0.1 is printed as 0.1. If two numbers represent 
 * numerically equivalent values (e.g., .1 = 0.1), then they must be listed in the same order as they were received as input).
